Student Records API
  
This is a FastAPI-based RESTful API for managing student records with JWT authentication. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for student data, including names, scores, and automatically calculated grades, stored in an SQLite database.

üöÄ Live API: [student-grades-api.onrender.com](https://student-grades-api.onrender.com)
üìÑ Swagger Docs: [student-grades-api.onrender.com/docs](https://student-grades-api.onrender.com/docs)

How to Run Locally (Optional)
The API is deployed on Render and accessible via the live URL above. Running locally with Uvicorn is optional and useful for development, testing, or debugging.
üîß Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
pip (Python package manager)
Virtual environment (recommended)

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository or Copy Files

Ensure all provided files (auth.py, crud.py, database.py, main.py, models.py, schemas.py, requirements.txt) are in the same directory.


Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt:pip install -r requirements.txt


The requirements.txt contains:fastapi
uvicorn
sqlalchemy
pydantic
passlib[bcrypt]
python-jose
pytz
python-multipart




Run the Application Locally

Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:uvicorn main:app --reload


The API will be available locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000.


Access the API

Use a browser or API client (e.g., Postman, cURL) to interact with the endpoints.
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for the local interactive Swagger UI or use the live Swagger Docs at student-grades-api.onrender.com/docs.



üìù Notes

The application uses an SQLite database (students.db) locally, which is separate from the Render deployment‚Äôs database.
The default user for testing is:
Username: butler
Password: password123


‚ö†Ô∏è Replace the SECRET_KEY in auth.py with a secure key in production, and ensure it‚Äôs configured in Render‚Äôs environment variables.
